Today, we explored client-side route-based functionality to create a more per-formant and modular single page web application.  These routes should be simple, with a single callback to render the page to the DOM.  One of the benefits of single page apps was adding a route to our page updates history API to allow for forward and back actions.  We also learned about the history API, page.js, identify useful urls for an app, and be able to implement those routes given the new library presented.
