Today in class we learned Functional Programming and also arrow functions.  The focus of today's class was on basic concepts of functional programming through the use of the follow array methods, such as: .forEach() , .map() , .filter() , and .reduce() .

We also touched on the IIFEs and Encapsulation.  I these subjects are my first time heard of them and I personally like the arrow method.  I think that is the method i will be focus on and it will be my style.
