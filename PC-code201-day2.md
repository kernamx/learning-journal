# PC-code201-day2
So far in day 2, we've learned more about html, css, and javascript.  At first, I was confused on some parts but after helped from the TA's everything was cleared.  The day 2 assignments required more practice on ACP method in Git Bash.  I've got the chance to practice more ACP and I started to memorized those commends in Git Bash.  Hey, you know what they said. "Practice, Practice, and Practice."  "Practice made it perfect."

Overall, my day 2 in 201 is good.  I am not behind of the lessen, yet.  I am really enjoying my day 2 in Code 201.
