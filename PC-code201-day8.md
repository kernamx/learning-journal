Today we learned about HTML forms and JS events.  We did a in class project on how to add an input form to an HTML document with properly structured HTML including the necessary <form>, <input>, <label>, and <fieldset>.  We also went over how to use JS events with the .addEventListener() method on a DOM element, using either a named or anonymous event handler function.  We also went over that add a new row to their data tables by storing, computing, and rendering data from the HTML form.  The stuff that we learned today was very useful in the future.
