Today is last day of the class we did summarize all the materials in 301.  In the afternoon, got together with our final project group.  Our group came up with an idea for an app that we are going to build.  Our app is about showing the area in Seattle where the is having food donation at certain time.  It's Friday, going to catch up on my assignments and study all of my materials in 301(finally).
