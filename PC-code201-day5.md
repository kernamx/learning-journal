Today we have a better understanding on how functions work in JavaScript, as well as the component pieces including declarations, calls, parameters, arguments, and returns.
We also learned more about publish a static webpage on GitHub by creating a gh-pages branch.  
We learned the use of images, color, and text formatting to style and HTML page.  That really helps me to understand CSS better.  I am glad i have my laptop today to practice the CSS demo that we did in class.
